# Legal-Domain-Classification-Using-Entity-Recognition

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying legal documents into different domains (e.g., civil, criminal, income tax, and constitutional rights) using Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Machine Learning techniques. We collected and labeled 900 legal judgments from Indian Kanoon, extracted embeddings using the T5 model, and applied various ML algorithms for classification. The system aids legal professionals in streamlining document categorization and analysis.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Legal Document Classification â€“ Categorizes judgments into distinct legal domains.
âœ… Named Entity Recognition (NER) â€“ Identifies key legal entities for classification.
âœ… Machine Learning Models â€“ Uses Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and more for classification.
âœ… Data Preprocessing â€“ Includes tokenization, lemmatization, and min-max normalization.
âœ… Hyperparameter Tuning â€“ Improves model accuracy using GridSearchCV.
